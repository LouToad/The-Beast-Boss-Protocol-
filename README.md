The Beast Boss Protocol

A README Manifesto for the New Cyber Order

by Lou Toad, aka the Iggy Pop of Coding

👊 Who I Am

I’m not here to join your club. I’m here to tear down the velvet ropes. I’m here to write code with my chest out, my history raw, and my vision feral. I’m the son of Larry Adams. A builder. A fixer. A man who didn’t flinch when things broke—he picked up a trowel and got to work.

I’m the builder’s heir. I’m the breaker of sacred terminals. I’m not from MIT. I’m from Meridian street dreams. From cracked pavement. From VHS static and open-source survival.

I’m Lou Toad. And I’m coming through the firewall like a ghost with a grudge.

🎤 What This Is

This is not a portfolio. This is not a CV. This is a disruption protocol. A README for the rooms I’m about to enter and refactor. If you think I don’t belong here— you’ve already lost the thread.

I’m not asking permission. I’m not looking for keys. I am the root user now.

🔥 Who This Is For

The artists who speak bash and paint in Python.

The kids who grew up on broken routers and cracked software.

The DIY punks who see the command line as a canvas.

The former retail workers who now grep through injustice.

The queers, the poets, the immigrants, the neurodivergents, the broke, the pissed off, the brilliant.


This README is for you. Not the old guard. Not the gatekeepers. Not the committee.

🛠️ My Stack

Linux: I build from the kernel out.

Python: My syntax is blues riff and static fuzz.

Bash: Because I believe in knowing what the machine feels.

Splunk / Wireshark / TryHackMe: These are my streetlights in the dark.

Markdown / ASCII / Lo-fi: I make art with what I have.


I do security like I do music: dirty, instinctive, layered with truth.

🧱 My Ethos

Structure reveals intent.

Repair is resistance.

Gatekeeping is cowardice with credentials.

The best revenge is showing up brilliant.

Every system is just another wall to climb.


You say I don’t belong here? I say: try and stop me.

🚪 Entry Points

I’ve built things. Broken things. Written books no publisher would touch until I bled them into Amazon. I’ve stood outside every room until I kicked the door in with a self-made key.

Here’s what you’ll find in my repos:

Security scripts that read like poetry.

Network analysis with a punk backbone.

Commentary on structure, decay, and defiance.

Tools for the people, not for profit.


This isn’t an application. This is a warning.

Lou Toad is in your system. And I’m not logging out.

🖖 Final Words

To the bootlickers, the blue bloods, the tech bros in Patagonia vests: stay seated. To the misfits, the dreamers, the ones with cracked screens and cracked voices: this is your signal.

Let’s burn the old structure down. Then build something better from the ash.
