# 🐍 The Beast Boss Protocol  
### _Support Stack to Security Track – by Laurence Todisco_

Welcome to my hands-on project hub — part lab log, part toolkit, part manifesto.

I'm Laurence Todisco, a Technical Support Engineer with a growing specialization in cybersecurity. This repo is where I experiment, learn, and build across support, scripting, log analysis, and system triage — with a long-term goal of joining a SOC or SecOps team.

## 🔐 Why This Exists

In the world of tech support, you're the first to see when systems break. I believe that's also where cybersecurity awareness is born. This repo is a personal proving ground for tools, concepts, and challenges at the intersection of support and defense.

### 2. **Wireshark + PCAP Analysis**
- `/pcap-analysis/` – Snapshots of malicious network traffic from lab work
- Notes on identifying C2 traffic, port scans, ARP spoofing

### 3. **SIEM + Security Triage**
- `/splunk-snippets/` – Saved search queries, detection logic, and notes
- `/incident-reports/` – TryHackMe-style lab walkthroughs simulating SOC tasks

### 4. **Utility Scripts for Support**
- `/vpn-checker/` – Bash script for basic VPN connectivity checks
- `/api-tester/` – Postman/requests-based API smoke test (JSON-based auth flow)

## 🧠 My Philosophy

> “Support is frontline reconnaissance. The logs tell the story — we just need to listen.”

I believe in learning by building, breaking, fixing, and documenting. I don't pretend to know everything, but I'm determined to learn with depth, care, and creativity. Whether it's an error code or a misconfigured firewall, there's a human and a system behind every problem.

> “The Beast Boss Protocol” began as a metaphor for learning under pressure.  
Now, it's my roadmap to becoming the kind of engineer who doesn’t just fix problems — but **detects, defends, and designs better systems**.
